To do this, we looked at a technique called sytematic reviewing which combines the evidence into a single report, and uses statistical techniques to bring the data from a number of studies together to create a single estimate of the effects of a treatment.The ways in which the costs of drugs and the economic impacts can be compared with those of existing treatments. To do this we looked at how a specific research technique, economic modelling, is used. We looked at  the different kinds of model, their value in HTA and how they are combined with the evidence from our systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of a treatment to produce estimates of costs/benefit. We also looked  at the final HTA report, to give a direct insight into the information that decision makers are presented with. We looked at how decision makers  use the HTA report, in conjunction with a wider range of information and input,  to make a final decision.We finished by briefly looking at how a decision to make a treatment available (or not) impacts on other health services.", "Available status": "Available now", "Software tools requirements": ""},
